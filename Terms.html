                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">These Terms of Use ("Terms") explain the conditions and necessary information for using our intelligent contact, which, through the use of artificial intelligence ("AI"), transcribes audios ("Intelligent Contact" or "translate.expert"). The translate.expert is the exclusive property of ITCBR.IO LTDA. By clicking the button indicating your acceptance, you declare that you agree to these Terms and to the use of translate.expert. You also declare, at this moment, that you possess the necessary powers to assume the declarations provided in these Terms, under penalty of liability.</p>
                <p class="mb-6">We inform you that translate.expert is part of an incentive program by Meta, the company that owns WhatsApp, for new products that use artificial intelligence. Consequently, by interacting with translate.expert, you also agree to Meta's terms and policies, subjecting yourself, among other conditions, to data processing, privacy measures, and AI usage by Meta, under the exact conditions offered by them. It is your responsibility to monitor any updates to Meta's terms of use and policies, as ITCBR.IO has no interference or responsibility in this regard.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">2. UPDATES AND IMPROVEMENTS</h2>

                <p class="mb-4">The use of the Intelligent Contact will not imply the creation of a profile for access to ITCBR.IO's proprietary platforms, therefore, this authorization of use does not constitute a license, even if non-exclusive, of any ITCBR.IO software.</p>

You are aware and agree that all solutions, insights, conversational flows, know-how, and evolutions of translate.expert are the exclusive property of ITCBR.IO.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">These Terms do not grant you any right to use the trademarks or other distinctive elements of translate.expert or ITCBR.IO.

You agree that any questions, comments, improvement suggestions, ideas, original or creative materials, or other information about translate.expert, its performance, language quality, assertiveness rate, and satisfaction, etc. ("Feedback") that you post, submit, or otherwise communicate to us will not be confidential, and we will have the right to use and disseminate, without restriction, the Feedback for any purpose, commercial or not, as well as to share it with Meta, without acknowledgment or compensation to you, excluding, in these cases, the sharing of your personal data.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">6. DATA COLLECTION AND CONSENT</h2>
